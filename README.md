# Implementation-of-Band-Limited-Multiple-Fourier-Linear-Combiner (BMFLC)-in-MATLAB
This project involves the implementation of BMFLC to estimate the voluntary and involuntary components of surgeon hand motion for the objective of tremor cancellation in the field of Interactive Medical Robotics. 

# Description
1. Given the complete signal representing the hand motion of a surgeon, the task is to estimate the voluntary and involuntary components of motion of surgeon's hand
2. Different forgetting factors were used to estimate the motion.
